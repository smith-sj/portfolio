          <p>
            I decided to put my recently acquired CSS knowledge to the test by creating some functional flash 
            cards using only CSS. As we were also learning about HTTP, it felt like a fitting theme for the project. 
            The term “mobile first” was also thrown around a lot in class this week, so I set out to make this 
            project functional on mobile first and then adjusted for desktop.

          <h3 class="post-subheading">General Layout and Animation</h3> 
          <p>
            I have to admit, learning CSS animation was easier than I thought it would be, that said, this 
            project uses some pretty basic ones. There are the initial fanout <b>keyframes</b> for each card, that 
            activate when the page loads and are responsible for the cards moving to their initial positions 
            and then there are the <b>transform</b> rules that are activated on hover (this was eventually changed 
            to on-tap, but we’ll get to that later.) Turns out CSS keyframes are really quite simple, 
            and they really just work.
          </p>
          <p>
            I found the most challenging part to be translating the layout and animations from mobile to 
            desktop. I ended up using dynamic sizing units for mobile and static sizing for desktop, it just 
            ended up being easier but did feel like I was cheating a little. If I find some spare time during 
            this crazy bootcamp, I’d like to refactor the desktop layout to use dynamic sizing as well.
          </p>
          <h3 class="post-subheading">The Hover Dilemma and Discovery of CSS Hacks</h3>
          <p>
            I now had a pretty cool deck of cards that fan out and then pop up when you hover over them. 
            As I was using Chrome developer tools in mobile layout, the hover effect translated pretty smoothly. 
            I just tapped (clicked) a card and it would pop up, and if I tapped another card it would pop up and 
            the other would pop down. The only issue was that you couldn’t tap the card to go back down. I was 
            okay with that. So I pushed it up to GitHub, deployed it to Pages, checked it on my Android phone 
            with Chrome and bam! It worked beautifully. Then I grabbed my partner’s iPhone, opened it up in 
            Safari and ”… oh.. No, what is this!?” Safari treats hover differently! And in this case, it was 
            horrible. On Safari you have to hold the card for a second to activate the hover effect, but since 
            the only place to press the card was text, it would select the text and you’d have this weird 
            highlighted nothingness. The whole experience just felt off. I could probably have fixed the text 
            selection problem. But the feeling of having to hold the cards was just bad in general. Since most 
            people will probably view this project with mobile Safari, this just wasn’t going to cut it.

            Then my brother came to the rescue. Yes, my actual brother, Derick Yearnsmith, CSS veteran and all-round 
            talented dude. He told me about these <em>CSS Hacks</em> - some sort of ancient art, known only by the bravest 
            of coders... and also explained in detail at <a class="post__link" href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks</a>. The 3 that Derick pointed me towards were 
            the <em>:target</em> trick, <em>Checkbox Hack</em> and <em>Radio Button Hack</em>. I won’t go into how they all work because CSS 
            Tricks does that better than I could, but I will say that I tried all of them and went with the 
            Checkbox Hack in the end. The :target trick was a bit janky - it worked - but it caused the page to 
            jump and although others have managed to implement it seamlessly, I couldn't get it to work nicely with 
            this project. The Radio Button Hack was smoother, and it worked well, but it had the one drawback of not 
            allowing you to tap a card back down, as is the case with radio buttons, the only way to deselect one 
            is to select another. So the Checkbox Hack won.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a nutshell, the card’s main container is a <b>label</b> with the <b>for</b> attribute set to an input with type 
            <b>checkbox</b>. The input should also include the hidden attribute, so that the checkbox is invisible. Over 
            in CSS land, the <b>:checked</b> pseudo-class selector is combined with <b>+ #cardID</b> to select the appropriate label. 
            The rule can then be whatever needs changing, in this case: the label’s transform. 
            The result is smooth and functional.
          </p>
          <h3 class="post-subheading">Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            I learned a lot from doing this little project, and as a bonus I got more comfortable branching and 
            merging in git. I could use this as some sort of menu on a portfolio site or something in the future, 
            but for now, I'll let it be a fun experiment.
