          <h3 class="post-subheading">What's it about?</h3>
          <p>
            Authored by Dave Shea, the original CSS Zen Garden launched almost 20 years ago, in 2003. It has since become one of the most well-known web development resources and
            has helped raise aesthetic standards of the web by demonstrating what can be accomplished with CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Participating in CSS Zen Garden involves 3 simple steps:
            <ol>
              <li>Download the HTML and CSS documents at this <a class="post__link" href="http://www.csszengarden.com" target="blank">link</a></li>
              <li>Style the webpage by only editing the CSS document</li>
              <li>Don't touch the HTML document</li>
            </ol>
            Simple? Yes. Easy?... Well, not for a CSS newbie.
          </p>
          <h3 class="post-subheading">The Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            In terms of <b>classes</b>, you get what you're given. There is no touching the HTML document, so you're stuck with Shea's document layout.
            As beautifully and expertly crafted as the document is, if an element isn't classed, you need to use pseudo-selectors to get at them;
            and if you want to insert anything into the document that isn't already there, you'll have to use pseudo-elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            This alone made the challenge worth it for me. As a new programmer, I had no idea of the power of CSS pseudo selectors and elements. Had I been permitted to insert
            images into the HTML file, I'd have never discovered that the ::before and ::after selectors can insert content. Not only that, but if you insert an empty string,
            you can then set a background-image and resize the pseudo element's box to effectively resize the image! <i>(you're probably reading this thinking, "no, duh"
            but this seriously blew my mind.)</i>
          </p>

        <h3 class="post-subheading">Mix-blend-mode</h3>
          <p>
            Pseudo-selectors weren't the only cool things I discovered. Turns out you can do all sorts of things with the CSS mix-blend-mode property, which I used throughout the
            project. The white sections of the webpage are simply paragraph elements with white backgrounds. The text and icons are actualy black, but, when changing 
            the mix-blend-mode to "screen", it has the effect of cutting the icon and letters out of the background. As a result, the text and icons share the same 
            colours as the main background and, even more pleasingly, its smooth gradient flows through them, uninterrupted.
          </p>

          <p>
            My final project was rather simple, but I think the techniques I used were effective. Ultimately, the vibrant gradient gave the page its personality, and
            everything else on the page lends itself to the red and blue hues. Combined with some simple visuals and a responisve layout, I think it makes for a pretty
            decent reading experience.  
          </p>

            The creators of this challenge have done an amazing service to the CSS community, especially newbies like myself, who need to be thrown in the deep end and 
            encouraged to think outside the box. CSS Zen Garden is a wonderful example of the true power of CSS and the fact that it has been around since 2003 and is still 
            inspiring programmers 20 years later just goes to prove the ingeniousness of its conception.
