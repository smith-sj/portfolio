            This is just a quick post to announce that I'm starting a Full Stack Web Developer bootcamp with Coder Academy. 
            Over 10-months I'll be working towards a Diploma of Information Technology, while learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby,
            Rails, Git, APIs, the MERN stack and probably some other scary stuff I don't know about yet.

            So far on my self-learning journey, I've practiced the fundamentals of programming through Python, and touched on some
            beginner API concepts while building a small weather application. I dived deeper into OOP with Dart & Flutter, creating an 
            app for the construction industry, which I'm currently cleaning up for my portfolio (apparently 'DRY' and refactoring code 
            were concepts I learned a little too late...) and played around with a bit of 3D game development with C# & Unity.
            It's a bit of a random path to take, I know, but it taught me something I didn't know about myself. I love to code, and I'm
            not terrible at it.
          </p>

          <p>
            One thing I have struggled with, if it's not already obvious, is finding a clear direction. I've been coding almost daily for the
            past year, and I've learned a lot on my own, but the tech world is a complex and overwhelming place. It's difficult not to get
            distracted by all of the different programming languages, frameworks, environments, tools, trends, philosophies... 
            even just trying to figure out which area of the industry I want to work in was tough. As someone trying to break into the industry, the web
            has every little bit of information, documentation and inspiration you need. But what I need is something to help me cut through all of the noise,
            and guide me to becoming not just a developer, but a good developer.</p>

            <p>
            I'll be documenting my learning here on this blog; I've found that writing about the things I learn helps them to stick, but also, I like the idea
            of someone in a similar place to where I am, getting something out of my posts.
