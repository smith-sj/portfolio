## Key Objectives

The following are some key objectives that I wanted to achieve while designing and building my portfolio.

1. Create a mobile first & responsive website
1. Make the website accessible and intuitive
1. Create a minimal & easy to digest portfolio for potential hirers

### Mobile First Responsive Layout

This objective focused on designing the website from a **mobile user's perspective**, before making adjustments to suit tablet and desktop users. *Mobile first* isn't just about viewports and layouts, but also involves consideration of the overall site map and functionality of each component. One of the first major decisions I made in this particular area, was to try and fit my important content on a single and well-organised, scrollable page. I had already decided that my website would take a minimal approach to content, as I wanted the reader to quickly and easily understand my skills, interests and personality, without being overwhelmed with information. I also found that a crucial aspect of a mobile website is easy navigation, so having to scroll back to a navigation to move around is not ideal. One solution would be to make a floating navbar that moves with the view, but as I wanted my content to be minimal, I thought just having all of my crucial details on a single page would be the best approach.
