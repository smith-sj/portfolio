        <summary>About</summary>
        <p>I'm training to be a Full-stack Web Developer in Melbourne, Australia. Here are a bunch of words about me that are true. This sentence is also about me and it contains facts that relate to my person. Much like the previous sentence this one is also about me and aims to talk about me just that little bit more. I hope you enjoyed reading this paragraph as much as I didn't enjoy writing it.</p>
